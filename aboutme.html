	<h2> about me </h2>
	<p> My name is Caoimhe Laird Phelan. I was born in Dublin and have lived here for my whole life. I'm 21 years of age and study Creative Digital Media in The Institute of Technology Blanchardstown. I work in Marketing and events in The Wright Venue. Both my job and my education are complete opposites but I couldn't do either without the other. Everything ties in.
	<br><br>
	I like to escape. I call myself a culture vulture. I have an uncomfortable feeling in my chest if I don't have an upcoming trip. I travel a lot, 3 times a year minimum. I will fly anywhere.
	<br><br>
	In my photography section you will see snippets of my travels. From tiny detailed bowls in Morocco to an Irish sunset. People say you should live in the moment rather than record it, but years later I'm glad I have.
